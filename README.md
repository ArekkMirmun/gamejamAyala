## **Game Description**  
In **MoonLight**, players explore a 2.5D map, facing roaming enemies, scavenging for weapons and medkits, and seeking help from unlikely allies. Strategy is crucial, especially when battles turn into **Pokémon-style turn-based combat** upon encountering enemies on the map.  

But not everything is as it seems. When the clock strikes **24:00**, the moon changes, transforming the night and summoning the **final boss**, a force that will push your skills to their limits.

## **Key Features**  

- **Dynamic Encounters**: Punch enemies on the map to initiate turn-based battles. Plan your moves carefully to outsmart and defeat your foes.  
- **Resource Management**: Collect weapons and medkits to prepare for increasingly difficult challenges. Every decision matters.  
- **NPC Interactions**: Talk to a priest who can heal your wounds and a farmer who might give you his gun—but only if you earn his trust.  
- **Midnight Event**: At 24:00, the moon transforms, heralding the arrival of the **final boss**. Are you ready for the ultimate challenge?
